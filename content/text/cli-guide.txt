Command Line Interface Guide

This guide covers the essential commands for working with Statue SSG from the command line.

Getting Started

To initialize a new Statue project, use the init command:
npx statue init --template default

This will create a new project with the default template structure including all necessary configuration files.

Development Server

Start the development server to preview your site locally:
npm run dev

The server will start on http://localhost:5173 by default. Changes to your content files will be reflected automatically.

Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of your site:
npm run build

This generates static HTML files in the build/ directory that can be deployed to any static hosting service.

Common Workflows

For a typical content update workflow:
1. Edit or create content files in the content/ directory
2. Preview changes with npm run dev
3. Build the site with npm run build
4. Deploy the build/ directory to your hosting service

Configuration

Site-wide settings are managed in site.config.js at the root of your project. This includes site name, description, contact information, and social media links.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during build, try clearing the node_modules directory and reinstalling dependencies with npm install.
