Plain Text File Support in Statue

Statue now supports native .txt files alongside .md files throughout your content directory. This feature allows you to write content in pure plain text without any markdown formatting.

How It Works

Place .txt files anywhere in your content/ directory, just like you would with .md files. The system automatically:
- Generates routes based on file paths
- Converts plain text to styled HTML paragraphs
- Applies the appropriate layout (docs, blog, or default)
- Includes files in directory listings

File Structure

Your .txt files follow the same organizational structure as markdown files:
content/docs/guide.txt → /docs/guide
content/blog/post.txt → /blog/post
content/legal/terms.txt → /legal/terms

Text Formatting

Plain text files use a simple paragraph system. Separate paragraphs with blank lines (double newline). Single line breaks within a paragraph are preserved.

No frontmatter is used - the file name becomes the page title automatically. For example, "getting-started.txt" becomes "Getting Started".

Use Cases

Plain text files are ideal for:
- Technical documentation and command-line guides
- Log files and system output examples
- Quick notes and simple content
- Legacy content that doesn't need markdown features
- Content where you want to focus on writing without formatting

Integration with Layouts

Text files work seamlessly with all Statue layouts:
- Docs layout: Includes sidebar navigation and table of contents area
- Blog layout: Shows author, date, and other blog metadata
- Default layout: Clean presentation with standard styling

The content automatically inherits your site's theme and styling, so text files look consistent with the rest of your site.

Technical Details

Text files are processed server-side during the build. The system:
1. Reads the raw text content
2. Escapes HTML characters for security
3. Splits content into paragraphs (double newline delimiter)
4. Wraps each paragraph in proper HTML tags
5. Applies your site's CSS theme variables

This ensures text files are both safe and beautifully rendered.
